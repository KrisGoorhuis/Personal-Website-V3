         Someone once told me my favorite puzzle game was essentially a 
         programming challenge. The instant I finished my first little
         word-reversing script I knew how right they were.

         I immediately began learning by doing, chewing through technologies 
         from Javascript web frameworks to Python machine learning tools to databases
         structuring and querying, and even game development with C# and Unity. 
         Sprinkle in some automated testing and a recently concluded web development
         internship, and Iâ€™m eager to begin this new career in earnest.

         Which brings me here. To where you are.
